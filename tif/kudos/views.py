# to research
# csrf mechanism for the form


# If a user is logged in (aka authenticated), then you can get their info by
# accessing variables of (the CustomUser class) request.user
# so name would be request.user.name and rank would be request.user.ranking


# there is a way to force people to have to log in first, but i'll try and see if i can
# do something on that on a different branch for now, you can temporarily hardcode values
# for testing and styling
