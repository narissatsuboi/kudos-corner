	# ok, so, i think we should list what we still need to do

	# i'll try update the rankings whenever the site is called just to be sure
	# are you still planning on working with the css? or the forms haha
	# hmm, i think the most important part is getting the forms to work
	# but for the sending kudos thing, how do you decide who to send it to?
	# username? email? id? 
	
	# i guess we can have a dropdown that displays usernames, but sends id to the db
	# not sure how to do it in here tho
	# ok


	# my list rn
	# CSS for the whole thing (basic, implement CSS grid and some borders around elements)
	# figure out forms and how to post to db from a form in django
	# log in page

# If a user is logged in (aka authenticated), then you can get their info by
# accessing variables of (the CustomUser class) request.user
# so name would be request.user.name and rank would be request.user.ranking

# there is a way to force people to have to log in first, but i'll try and see if i can
# do something on that on a different branch for now, you can temporarily hardcode values
# for testing and styling
